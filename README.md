# MIMICSimulation  
We used Biogears engine to simulate patients in MIMIC, initializing them using their readings in MIMIC, and administering IV fluids and vasopressors at each time step as done in MIMIC. We overrode the patient blood chemistry to simulate MIMIC readings. (See [SepsisSimulation_main.cpp](https://github.com/faaizT/core/blob/mimic-simulator/projects/howto/SimulationScripts/src/SepsisSimulation_main.cpp) for more details.)
