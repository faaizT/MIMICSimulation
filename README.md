# MIMICSimulation  
We used Pulse to simulate patients in MIMIC, initializing them using their readings in MIMIC, and administering IV fluids and vasopressors at each time step as done in MIMIC. (See [MIMICSimulator.py](https://gitlab.kitware.com/faaizT/engine/-/blob/local-changes/src/python/pulse/rlengine/SimulationEngine.py) for more details.)
